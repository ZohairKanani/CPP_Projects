# Library Management System

This repository contains a C++ project that implements a library management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project models real-world library operations by representing key entities as classes and objects.

## Overview

The system is designed around several core classes:
- **Book**: Represents a single book in the library.
- **BookList**: Manages a collection of books using a linked list structure.
- **User**: Represents an individual library user.
- **Library**: Coordinates overall library operations, including tracking users and managing the book inventory.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects to mirror real-world entities, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
- **Core C++ Concepts**: Leverages functions, loops, and conditional statements to implement dynamic functionality such as user management and inventory tracking.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: Each class encapsulates specific data members and member functions, making the system easy to extend and maintain.
